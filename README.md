# 💰 MoneyMind: Your Behavioral Finance Copilot

MoneyMind is a behavioral finance platform designed to help users understand **how** they think about money—not just what they do with it.

Instead of starting with sensitive financial data, MoneyMind begins with a **lightweight behavioral quiz** to assess cognitive biases, emotional tendencies, and decision-making styles. Later, with user permission, it integrates with real financial accounts using the **Plaid API** to match instinct with action—powering deep, personalized insights.
